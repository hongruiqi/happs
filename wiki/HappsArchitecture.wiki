 #summary HAppS architecture.

= Introduction =

This is an overview of the HAppS architecture.

= Details =

The event system is based on the state monad. You have updates {{{(a -> (a, ()))}}} and queries {{{(a -> ret)}}}. HAppS takes care of durability itself.

Events can either be created by {{{expose}}} or by hand.
Creating events by hand is only necessary if you need exact control of the serialization process.
