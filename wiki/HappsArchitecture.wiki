#summary HAppS architecture.

= Introduction =

This is an overview of the HAppS architecture.

= Details =

Structurally, a HAppS application is a list/tree of handlers that are tried in order.

In this example, anyRequest is always matched, and it returns "hello world"
{{{
module Main where 

import HAppS
import HAppS.Server.StdConfig ( serverConfig )
import qualified Text.XHtml as TXH

main = start serverConfig { http=[anyRequest $ ok $ TXH.h1 $ TXH.toHtml "hello world"] }
}}}
