This page answers two questions:
  * Why XSLT?
  * How do I use XSLT with HAppS?

# Why XSLT? #

A stylesheet separates contents and structure from presentation.

The same data may be served from your webapp to a browser on a desktop, phone, or handheld tablet.
You may wish to write a separate application that merges information from your webapp with something like Google Maps, thus making a whole new application.
For cases like these, life is easier if the presentation of the content is separate from the content itself.
